Chinese group helps slum children discover their talents - Chinadaily.com.cn
Esther Ayuma, a 16-year-old student in a secondary school, born and brought up in Mathare, the second-largest slum in Kenya's capital Nairobi, always admired and was passionate about dancing.
Convinced that artistic dancing is one of the best paying careers across the globe, she yearned for an opportunity to discover and nurture her talents but she lacked a platform.
The launch of an art program by Dream Building Service Association, a Chinese charity organization operating in the slum, was thus an unexpected and timely opportunity. She has been nurturing her skills under the organization since 2014 and has participated in four talent shows organized by the charity.
On Saturday, the organization's fourth talent show was held, where both younger and older children exhibited their dancing, modeling and artistic skills.
"My dream is to establish a dance group in the future, and to perform in events in and outside the country, as well as train young girls and boys to discover and nurture their dancing skills," she said.
