China to boost ties, advance Belt and Road Initiative in Africa - Chinadaily.com.cn
China will step up cooperation with African countries and will jointly advance the Belt and Road Initiative to help Africa address challenges of maintaining peace and security and promoting development, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday.
Wang said that the profound friendship between China and Africa will remain unbreakable, quoting President Xi Jinping’s statement that China and Africa are friends tested by adversity and such friendship must not be forgotten.
“Africa faces challenges of maintaining peace and security, and of promoting development and revitalization. In response to the needs, China will step up mediation in regional hotspots as well as cooperation with African countries on unconventional security threats such as terrorism, piracy and natural disaster,” Wang said at a news conference on the sidelines of the ongoing annual session of the National People's Congress.
The Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation will be held in September in Beijing where Chinese and African leaders will discuss their cooperation in the new era and focus on jointly advancing the Belt and Road Initiative and turning China and Africa into a community with a shared future, according to Wang.
“Africa is an indispensable partner in our effort to build a global community with a shared future. China welcomes our African brothers and sisters in getting on board of the fast train of development,” the minister said.
