Medical experts return favor to Zimbabwe - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
A medical team consisting of 12 experts left Changsha, Hunan province, for Zimbabwe on Monday to help it fight the coronavirus pandemic.
The chartered plane also carried medical supplies, such as ventilators, testing instruments and masks that were donated by the Hunan government.
African countries, including Zimbabwe, offered help when the coronavirus hit China, and now it's time for China to return the favor, provincial authorities who saw the experts off at the Changsha airport said.
The team will stay in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital, for two weeks to offer treatment suggestions and share prevention experience with local people.
