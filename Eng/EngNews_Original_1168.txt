African Union chair hails progress in China-Africa ties - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, hailed the significant and sustained progress that has been made in China-Africa ties. Mahamat made the assessment while he outlined his vision as he seeks a second term in office.
"With China, significant and sustained progress has been made within the framework of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). For the first time, the African Union was considered as a major actor in China-Africa cooperation, governed by FOCAC,” Mahamat said in his analysis of his first term as AU Commission chairman published on Tuesday.
He reiterated the AU Commission's strong commitment to upholding multilateralism and supporting international partners in halting the trend of unilateralism. He added that Africa will continue to seek partners who promote African solutions to African problems.
“We will engage with partners who respect the basic principle that Africa belongs to Africans. We are seeking African solutions for African problems solved by and between Africans. Africa stands with those who fight unilateralism and strongly advocate for a multilateralism of respect, equality and mutual benefit," he said.
Mahamat is seeking to renew his mandate as chair of the AU Commission at the 34th Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the AU scheduled for Feb 6 and 7.
