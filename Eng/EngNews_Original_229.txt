Chinese medical practitioner awarded for his service in Sierra Leone - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Liu Yu, a member of a Chinese medical aid team sent to Sierra Leone, was recently awarded for his service in the African country since last May.
Last year, he and his teammates drove 400 km on bumpy roads and saved the life of a patient who suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, carrying out surgery under mobile flashlights.
Liu said: "Although not everyone in Western Africa knows about Lei Feng in China, it's our mission to carry his spirit with us no matter where we are in the world."&nbsp;
