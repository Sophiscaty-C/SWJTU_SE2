Egypt is a favorable attraction to hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists each year for its historical sites and sunny sandy beaches.
Nearly half a million Chinese tourists visited Egypt in 2018 compared with only 300,000 in 2017, amid expectations of more tourists visiting the Middle Eastern country in 2019, according to official statistics.
