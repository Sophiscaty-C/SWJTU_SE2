China-Africa brotherhood bolstered in joint anti-pandemic efforts - Chinadaily.com.cn
NAIROBI - The past few months have witnessed an ever-growing brotherhood and solidarity between China and Africa, which are joining hands in tackling the still-unfolding COVID-19 pandemic.
When the first case was confirmed on the African continent on Feb. 14, China, despite being ravaged by the virus then, rushed forward to help its African brothers by unreservedly providing medical supplies, sharing experience, as well as sending expert teams.
So far, Africa's anti-epidemic efforts have achieved gratifying results despite the growing number of confirmed cases, maintaining a mortality rate far below the global average, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).
<strong>SUCCESSIVE MISSIONS WIN ACCLAIM</strong>
On April 16, a 12-member team of health experts from the Chinese city of Tianjin arrived in Burkina Faso.
Visiting the Tengandogo University Hospital in Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou twice, the Chinese experts shared their experience in fighting the virus with their local counterparts, who are caring for an increasing number of COVID-19 patients.
Alexandre Sanfo, director-general of the hospital, told Xinhua that the experience shared by the Chinese experts boosted the country's COVID-19 prevention and control work, as well as its response system.
According to the Chinese Embassy in Burkina Faso, the team made a total of four field visits, and held eight training workshops, 14 interdisciplinary meetings, and 40 technical sessions during their stay in the West African country.
After the heavy workload in Burkina Faso, the team went to Abidjan, the capital city of Cote d'Ivoire, on a similar mission at the invitation of the Cote d'Ivoire government.
