Drive-in movie van a hit in rural Africa - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
A mobile cinema screening domestic films is proving popular with villagers in Zambia, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo and Senegal, Fang Aiqing reports.
A film screen on wheels that has been touring villages in the West African country of Senegal, has been giving locals the chance to catch up on the latest Chinese movies for free.
Fourteen screenings of Chinese films dubbed into French were held in seven villages around the Senegalese capital of Dakar and the inland city of Thies from July 12 to 18.
Apart from kung fu movies, which have long been popular with African audiences, other lesser known genres popular in China such as animations, fantasy and romantic movies have also been screened.
Some of the films reflected contemporary popular culture in China.
Senegalese viewer Coumba Sarr said many of the themes resonated with her despite the vast distances between the two countries, especially those dealing with the complicated relationship between mothers-in-law and their daughters-in-law.
Around 10,000 people attended the screenings, according to StarTimes Ltd, a Chinese digital TV service provider and organizers of the program. As part of the Carnival of Chinese Films and TV Dramas project, 61 screenings have been held in 22 villages in Zambia, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo and Senegal since its launch in July 2017.
