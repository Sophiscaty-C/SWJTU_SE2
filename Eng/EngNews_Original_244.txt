Namibian president leaves for state visit to China - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
WINDHOEK - Namibian President Hage Geingob on Tuesday left for China for a seven-day state visit.
In an interview with Xinhua in Windhoek, Geingob said that China had witnessed spectacular growth over the past four decades with average GDP growth at around 10 percent and lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty, which was nothing short of a miracle.
Today, Geingob said, China, as the second largest economy, has nodes of excellence in several industries, including ICT, manufacturing and industrial equipment, with several companies having operations spanning the entire globe.
Geingob said Namibia was ready to work with China in various fields to advance development and friendship between the two countries.
Geingob said he was glad that Namibia would participate in China's Belt and Road Initiative.
"We believe that the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation provides more focused synergies between China and Africa," Geingob said, adding that China's role in peace and security through the UN Security Council was commendable.
Geingob also said China's developmental role through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and other minilateral fora such as the BRICS attests to its emergence as a key player now and in the future.
