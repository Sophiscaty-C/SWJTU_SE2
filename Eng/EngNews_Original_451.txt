Actress Hai Qing joins efforts to protect Africa's elephants - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
For World Elephant Day, actress Hai Qing is partnering with WildAid to further call attention to the plight of African elephants by encouraging people to view elephants in the wild instead of buying ivory as a souvenir.
In collaboration with WildAid, Tanzania Tourism, and China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hai Qing visited Tanzania earlier this year and saw first-hand the beauty of wild elephants, and also learned about the huge threats they face from poaching.
Poaching of elephants across Africa is ravaging populations, with an estimated 20,000-30,000 killed each year to supply demand for ivory. Formerly one of the largest ivory markets in the world, China banned the sale of ivory on Dec 31, 2017 and is now strengthening elephant conservation efforts.
This new partnership between WildAid and Hai Qing features video and billboard messages that will be displayed around China especially targeting travelers to Africa.
