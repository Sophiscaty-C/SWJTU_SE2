BEIJING - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat jointly hosted the Seventh China-AU strategic dialogue in Beijing on Thursday, seeking closer cooperation in various fields.
"Building a community with a shared future for mankind has been set as the general goal of Chinese diplomacy at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In order to achieve that, a shared future for China and African countries is an indispensable part," Wang said.
China is ready to work with African countries to make China-Africa relations a role model for South-South cooperation, he said.
"China consistently views the China-AU ties from a strategic and long-term perspective, and supports the AU's leading role in the peace and development of Africa," Wang said, adding that China will further cooperate with the AU in various fields, including transnational and transregional infrastructure construction, peace and security, public health, tourism, and aviation.
Faki said the AU and African countries attach great importance to their relations with China and appreciate China's longtime support.
"The AU is ready to work with China to strengthen cooperation in trade and investment, personnel exchanges, civil aviation and other areas," Faki said.
"We support and welcome the establishment of a representative office of the AU in China, and stand ready to provide assistance," said the foreign minister.
Faki said the AU appreciates China's approval and believes the office will bring new vigor to AU-China relations.
Hailing the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) as an important platform, Faki said the FOCAC summit to be held in Beijing in September will effectively promote the partnership between China and Africa. "I would be glad to participate in the summit on behalf of the AU Commission," he said.
