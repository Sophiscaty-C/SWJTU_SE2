TUNIS, March 10&nbsp; -- A self-driving tractor with application of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) was tested successfully Sunday in northwestern Tunisia.
The representatives of China-Arab BDS/GNSS center and the Arab Information and Communication Technologies Organization (AICTO), as well as the academic staff of an engineering school in Mjez El-Beb region in northwestern Tunisia, attended the test ceremony.
This smart tractor, used in various agricultural activities, was equipped with a BDS, so that it can be controlled remotely without a driver.
&quot;I am very impressed and surprised by the quality of the equipment offered by BeiDou,&quot; said Sami Trimech, the strategic planning and development director at AICTO.
&quot;We had a dream to bring BeiDou to the Arab countries,&quot; said Nour Laabidi, the project manager at AICTO and head of China-Arab BDS/GNSS center in Tunisia.
&quot;This is a pilot project. We are happy to implement it in our country and I hope that all Arab countries will be able to use this Chinese technology,&quot; said Laabidi.
Hassan Kherroubi, a specialist in the mechanical industry at the Mjez El-Beb engineering school, stressed the contribution of this Chinese technology to the agricultural sector in Tunisia.
According to Kherroubi, a series of agricultural activities, including the harvest, will be more profitable and more effective with such technologies.
&quot;Our main concern is to benefit all Arab and African countries of this fruitful cooperation between Tunisia and China,&quot; Kherroubi said, adding that this advanced technology will bring a bright future to the region.
BDS is compatible with other navigation systems, such as GPS, and users can receive services from both systems at the same time, improving positioning accuracy.
