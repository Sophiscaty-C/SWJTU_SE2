China is willing to better align the Belt and Road Initiative with the development strategies of the Republic of Congo to further promote bilateral ties and cooperation, said Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday when meeting with Denis Sassou Nguesso, president of the Republic of Congo.
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries have undertaken mutual respect, equal treatment and sincere interactions, and promoted enduring friendship despite changes in the international scene, Li said. China is willing to keep high-level exchanges with the African country to consolidate political trust, he said.
The Congo president congratulated Li on the successful 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which he believed injected new impetus into China-African relations. The Belt and Road Initiative is being carried out to help African countries in their national development, he said. The Republic of Congo is willing to enhance cooperation with China in infrastructure, telecommunication, agriculture and other fields, he added.
