China's 2nd peacekeeping helicopter unit in Sudan's Darfur finish equipment inspection - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
KHARTOUM -- China's second peacekeeping helicopter unit in Sudan's Darfur region has finished the third contingent-owned equipment inspection.
"Chinese helicopter unit has always maintained good morale and outstanding performance," said Amela, head of the inspection team of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID).
Officers and soldiers of the helicopter unit accepted the inspection with various types of equipment placed orderly on the ground and materials displayed in the warehouse.
The four-hour inspection covered seven categories, including weapons and ammunition, fire-fighting instruments, vehicles and machines as well as welfare facilities.
The frequent use and long-duration performance of the equipment of the helicopter unit presents great challenges to routine maintenance amid harsh conditions in Darfur.
Logistic staff of the helicopter unit kept the equipment in good condition by regular maintenance and checks.
They also enhanced examination of weapons, communication equipment and security infrastructure.
