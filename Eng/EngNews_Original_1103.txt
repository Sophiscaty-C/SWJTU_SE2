ACCRA -- Tsinghua University, one of the most prestigious universities in China, seeks academic cooperation with African universities to help groom human resources for the continent's development, an official said Tuesday.
Yang Bin, vice president of Tsinghua University, made the remarks in a virtual forum with the Ghanaian Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) as part of the Ghana-China economic and cultural week program.
Yang said the Tsinghua University seeks to build an inclusive and resilient educational structure with its partners in Africa, adding that information literacy, compassion, and solidarity would stand the test of time in the face of crises.
The dean of international programs at KNUST Rexford Assasie-Oppong said the university takes its relationship with China very seriously, with some of its teachers trained in Chinese universities.
"We look forward to growing this cooperation with Tsinghua University," Assasie-Oppong added.
