Together with other African counterparts, Kenya's medical team held a video conference with Chinese officials and doctors aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 on Wednesday.
"Today for the first time, via a video conferencing capacity which we have just installed, our doctors were able to carry out a video conference with Chinese doctors, the ones who have been handling the disease in Wuhan," said Mutahi Kagwe, the cabinet secretary of Kenya's Ministry of Health.
"This is an extremely important step in terms of knowledge share and it gave us a tremendous amount of knowledge which we believe will also go a long way to assisting our people," he added.
Stone He, CEO of Huawei Kenya, who provided the video equipment, said, "Huawei is fully committed to supporting Kenya's response efforts. I am delighted that the equipment was so useful. It is a good example of how technology can help with communications, collaboration and coordination which are a critical part of the response to the threat of COVID-19."
The Kenyan medical team included more than 10 officials and experts. Their purpose was to learn the Chinese experience in fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic and discuss the best approaches for prevention and control.
As of Wednesday, Kenya has confirmed seven cases of COVID-19 and there are more than 600 cases in the Africa continent.
