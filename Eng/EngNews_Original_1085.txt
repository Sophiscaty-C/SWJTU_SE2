Africa thankful for a 'reliable partner' - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
China indeed remains a valued partner for Africa, particularly given the fragile global political economic situation,&nbsp;said former senior South African diplomat Gert Johannes Grobler.
Grobler, who served as South Africa's ambassador to Spain, Japan and Madagascar and is now a senior research fellow at the Institute of African Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, was speaking at the online Vision China event organized by China Daily on Wednesday.
&quot;In fact, Africa and China are now as we speak busy charting the way forward on cooperation in the post-pandemic era as was illustrated by the outcome of the successful, extraordinary China and Africa Summit on Solidarity against COVID-19,&quot; he said.
Hailing China as &quot;a reliable partner for Africa&quot;, the former diplomat said that China has always honored its commitments in an efficient, pragmatic and result-oriented manner.
&quot;Africa knows that China is prepared to continue to share its development experience with Africa as a friend in need in the challenging times we're living and the challenging road ahead,&quot; Grobler said.
