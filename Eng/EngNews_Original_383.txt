It will retail at a recommended price of $99 on Jumia.com, an online retailer and retail stores across the country.

Huawei Y5 Prime 2018 features the Huawei full view display; the Android 8.1.0 system and the 3020mAh battery ensure the performance even longer. It also features a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera with selfie toning flash, making selfies more artistic and expressive.

It also features a three-card slot design to simultaneously support primary and secondary Nano SIM cards as well as a Micro SD card (not standard configuration) up to 256G (optional).
