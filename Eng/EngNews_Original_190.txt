Transportation deal gives lift to Chinese firms in Kenya - Chinadaily.com.cn
The Chinese business community in Kenya will be able to get their products shipped from China faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost, following the signing of an agreement between Kenya Railways and Cargocare International Ltd, on behalf of Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce, also known as the KCCC.
According to Atanas Maina, the managing director of Kenya Railways, as known as KR, the agreement involves delivery of cargo from China through the port of Mombasa to the Inland Container Depot, known as the ICD, in the Embakasi district of the capital Nairobi, for clearance.
Cargo will be transported via the Chinese-built Standard Gauge Railway, known as the SGR, from Mombasa to Nairobi, which launched cargo services on Jan 1, 2018.
"Transporting cargo via railway is cheaper compared to road, and will therefore reduce the cost of production of goods and services," Maina said.
He added that Kenya Railways is committed to offering customers the best services ever, and assured Chinese traders of efficient, safe and reliable cargo transportation, and clearing and forwarding services.
