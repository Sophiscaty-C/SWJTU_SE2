EazzyBanking App upgraded to Chinese Mandarin version - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Kenya's Equity Bank's EazzyBanking App is now available in Chinese Mandarin, following a recent upgrade that will allow the growing number of Chinese expatriates working in the East African region to access banking services in their native language.
Users can download and/or upgrade the Chinese Mandarin-enabled EazzyBanking App on Google Play Store.
The move to offer the EazzyBanking App in Chinese Mandarin will consolidate the bank's effort to tap into the growing Sino-Kenya trade which has been steadily growing in recent years.
To further cater for this sector, Equity Bank set up a fully-fledged Chinese desk in 2012 to serve Chinese corporate and retail clients. The upgraded app is aimed at furthering convenience to these retail customers.&nbsp;
Other convenience enhancing features that the lender has rolled out for its customers include the interoperability feature that allows customers to send and receive money from any mobile money wallet or any account in other banks.
Equity Group reported a 14 per cent growth in profit after tax for the year ended December 2017. It was one of the very few banks to report profitability last year. The bank's assets currently stand at $5.2 billion.
