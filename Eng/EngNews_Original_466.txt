MONROVIA - Liberian leader George Weah on Monday embarked on his first trip to China since taking office earlier this year as president of Africa's oldest republic.
A statement by his office confirmed that Weah departed the country ahead of the Beijing Summit of Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) scheduled on Sept 3-4.
The footballer-turned president will attend the summit for the first time as the head of state. He had previously been to China three times, including twice as a footballer.
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Weah said Liberia will seek development opportunities at the FOCAC, a platform that promotes equal consultation, enhances understanding and strengthens friendship and cooperation between African countries and China.
