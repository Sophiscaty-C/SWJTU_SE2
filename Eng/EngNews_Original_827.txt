BEIJING -- The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday refuted the United States media reports about "Chinese military personnel taking irresponsible actions in Djibouti," saying this information does not align with the facts.
Some US media outlets reported that the Chinese military tried to "constrain international airspace" and deployed drones designed to interfere with US flight operations in Djibouti.
"This information does not align with the facts," said Lu Kang, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when asked for comments at a regular daily news briefing held Monday.
"China has always abided by international laws and laws of the host countries and is committed to maintaining regional safety and stability," Lu said.
