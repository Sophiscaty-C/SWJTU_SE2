Premier Li Keqiang called to strengthen cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative when meeting with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on Sunday.
China cherishes traditional friendship with Sudan and has regarded the country as its good friend and partner in Africa and Arab world, Li said. China supports Sudan in choosing its own path for development and the endeavors by Sudan and South Sudan to maintain peace, he said.
Li said more potential should be tapped to expand pragmatic cooperation in trade, investment and agriculture, which will make new contributions to social and economic development of both countries.
Bashir said next year will mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties. Both countries have achieved productive yields in pragmatic cooperation in various fields and have great potential for future cooperation.
He extended gratitude for China's help in maintaining Sudan's stability and development and said exchanges between the two countries have further moved forward the South-South cooperation and China-Africa cooperation.
