As the recently concluded Belt and Road Forum sketches a new blueprint for international cooperation, Startimes, a Chinese company that provides digital television programming, will enhance connectivity in broadcasting and promote development of the digital TV industry in Africa, Startimes President Pang Xinxing says. 
Startimes hosted the seventh Africa Digital TV Development Seminar on May 22 in Beijing. 
With the theme of universalized digital TV and enjoying the "smart" life, the seminar was aimed at exploring and discussing the development of Africa's digital television industry to make the continent's people have higher-quality lives. 
The digital TV provider is looking forward to having discussions with guest countries on the implementation of digital broadcasting and the popularization of digital TV and hopes to help Africa's transition to a "smart" society, Pang says. 
Since setting up its first branch in Rwanda in 2007, Startimes has broadcast to more than 30 African countries with 9 million subscribers within a decade, leading the company to become the fastest-growing, most influential digital TV operator in Africa. 
To provide a better viewing experience, dubbing artists who are winners of dubbing competitions have translated 240 Chinese TV series - a total of 7,500 hours of programs - in local languages. 
When the dubbing center's Beijing headquarters begins operations, the dubbing production will reach 100,000 hours each year, Startimes Vice-President Guo Ziqi says. 
Tong Gang, the vice-minister of China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, says officials will continue to strengthen the political communication of media cooperation between China and Africa. China will deepen media cooperation with Africa to expand content cooperation to boost the development of China's and African countries' media industries, Tong says. 
Raufu Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's minister of information and culture, thinks highly of Chinese development progress and hopes for a successful experience for his country. 
Working with Chinese enterprises such as Startimes to enhance communication and cooperation about digital broadcasting and content production will boost overall economic development, he says. 
The digital TV development seminar, which lasted for two days, drew government officials and representatives from enterprises and organizations from 46 countries. Western delegations included Time Warner, Disney and AB Group.
