BEIJING - Huang Kunming, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, met with a delegation from the South African Communist Party (SACP) led by its General Secretary Blade Nzimande Wednesday.
Huang, who is also head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, said Marxism has significantly advanced human civilization and still has great influence in the world, quoting the remarks made by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, at last Friday's conference marking the 200th anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx.
