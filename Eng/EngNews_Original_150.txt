Kenyan students meet prospective Chinese employers - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Kenya's university graduates got a rare opportunity on Wednesday to interact with prospective Chinese employers, thanks to the second edition of the job fair for Kenyan students held at the University of Nairobi.
Co-organized by the Kenya-China Economic and Trade Association and Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce and hosted by the Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi, the job fair brought together over 50 Chinese enterprises operating in Kenya.
During the job fair, students got an opportunity to acquire firsthand information on the contemporary skills required during job recruitment. Several students left their CVs, or resumes, with various companies.
According to Li Xuhang, the charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy, the companies presented 1,000 job vacancies to Kenyan students.
"The job fair was organized to provide a platform for young people to connect with Chinese enterprises," he said, adding that the embassy was offering two vacancies during the fair.
Li said young people are the future of a nation. "A nation will prosper only when its young people are empowered. A country will be full of hope and a great tomorrow only when its young generation has ideas, abilities and a strong sense of responsibility," he said.
Noting that the competition in the 21st century is in human capital, Li encouraged Chinese companies to take full advantage of the job fair to discover and employ young talent.
Guo Ce, the economic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, said this year's number of enterprises doubled compared to last year.
"I hope Chinese companies will continue to offer job opportunities to local people. So far over 42,000 have been employed by Chinese companies," he said.
