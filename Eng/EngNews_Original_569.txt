China would like to strengthen the alignment of development strategies with Nigeria and promote cooperation in trade, investment, production capacity and infrastructure, said Premier Li Keqiang when meeting with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday.
Over recent years, the China-Nigeria strategic partnership has seen steady growth and resulted in productive yields, Li said.
The two economies are highly complementary with great potential, and China is willing to provide support within its own capability for Nigeria's social development, he said.
Competitive Chinese companies are encouraged to conduct cooperation with Nigeria in trade, investment, production capacity and infrastructure projects to achieve win-win outcomes, based on market rules, the premier said.
Buhari extended congratulations on the successful 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which concluded on Tuesday.
He also extended gratitude to China for its support in humanitarian aid, the professional training of young Nigerians, agricultural modernization and infrastructure, which he said had boosted the welfare of the Nigerian people.
The African country is committed to further boosting mutually-beneficial cooperation with China, the president added.
