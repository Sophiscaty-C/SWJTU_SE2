Mozambique receives Chinese rice donations - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Two Chinese development funds together donated a total 100 tons of rice to Mozambique on March 27, the biggest amount delivered to Cyclone Idai-stricken areas since March 16.
The rice was produced by the Wanbao Africa Agriculture Development Co, a company in Mozambique invested in by the two organisations: the China-Africa Development Fund (CADFund), and the China-Portuguese Speaking Countries Cooperation and Development Fund.
CADFund is one of the "Eight Measures" for China-Africa practical cooperation announced by the Chinese government on the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. Inaugurated on 26 June, 2007, the fund aims to encourage and support Chinese enterprises to invest in Africa.
The Chinese Ambassador to Mozambique Su Jian was present to deliver a speech at the donation ceremony.
