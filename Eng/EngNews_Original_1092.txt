Chinese envoy to Kenya hails ties amid pandemic - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Zhou Pingjian, the Chinese ambassador to Kenya, hosted a reception on Sept 28 to mark the 71st anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China via videoconference.
While indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic had necessitated the virtual reception, Zhou said that the pandemic has also revealed the strong cooperation that exists between Kenya and China. He said this was seen in how the two countries, under their able leaders, were able to assist each other through the challenges brought about by the virus.
"China and Kenya share a profound tradition of friendship. Our long-lasting and fruitful cooperation stands out when it comes to Africa-China relations. Our cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic represents a proud example of solidarity in the face of a common challenge," Zhou said.
"China will work with Kenya to realize the promise of the Belt and Road Initiative as well as the promise of the Forum for China Africa Cooperation. China will always see African states as development partners no matter how the international landscape may be shaped," he added.
The online event -- which was attended by delegations from both Kenya and China, including Esther Passaris, the Nairobi woman representative of parliament -- was treated to graceful performances by both Kenyan and Chinese artists.
