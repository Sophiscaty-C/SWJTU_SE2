25 Liberians to receive elevator training in China - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
The Chinese embassy in Liberia is providing a training opportunity for 25 Liberians in the field of elevator management and technology. The training, which will be held in Changsha, Central China's Hunan province, is intended to strengthen the capacity building of Liberians, and will last for one month.
Since January 2019, more than 450 different training opportunities have been provided by the Chinese embassy, said Li Jiang, commercial counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Liberia.
Li explained that new China-aided projects are expected in the next few years, and that these projects will help improve the economic and social development of China-Liberia relations.
Li stated that in the last five years, over 2,300 Liberians have acquired training in vegetable planting, rattan and bamboo weaving, broadcasting, stadium facilities, automobile repair, and architecture.
He said that China is looking forward to promoting collaboration and making greater progress for friendship with Liberia in the years to come.
For his part, Albert D. Dossen, an elevator technician at the Liberian Senate, praised the People's Republic of China for providing another opportunity where Liberians can acquire technical skills in elevator maintenance.
Dossen said he has been one of the beneficiaries of such training provided by China, and following that training, he became employed at the Liberian Parliament, House of Senate Maintenance Department.
"I want to thank China for the opportunities they continue to provide to Liberians. If it had not been for China, I wouldn’t have been employed at the Liberian Senate," Dossen told colleagues who are departing for China on Tuesday.
The 25 Liberians are from the Ministry of Youth & Sports and the Liberia Elevator Association.
