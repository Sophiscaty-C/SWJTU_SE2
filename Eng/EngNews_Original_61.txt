The road to joint legal cooperation - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
It's not news that China and Africa have been accelerating economic cooperation since President Xi Jinping proposed the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. Since then, Chinese companies have been seeking opportunities in Africa - opening branches, investing in local businesses and building roads and railways. These companies are forging a multinational workforce in Africa, with Chinese and local employees working under the same roof. They not only speak different languages, but also have different legal systems. In order to settle legal complaints properly, law professionals are required to understand the different legal systems.
Here we interviewed some African law professionals who came to Beijing for a 20-day training course. A total of 30 students from 21 countries with experience as lawyers, judiciaries, or legal counselors attended the course hosted by Beijing Foreign Studies University.
