African young man's road to learning in China - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
A 27-year-old African man known as "Hero" came from Congo. He had heard many Chinese stories during childhood and became interested in Chinese medicine, so he came to Shenyang Medical College six years ago to study clinical medicine.
As he learned professional knowledge, he also assiduously studied the Chinese language and now speaks Mandarin so fluently his classmates think of him as a China hand.
Hero is applying for a master’s program, so he can continue his studies in cardiovascular-related disciplines and strive to obtain a Chinese medical license to stay in China as a doctor. Hero said: "I hope to give my youth and knowledge back to my alma mater, Shenyang Medical College. I will return here as a professor and lead students like me into medicine, into China. I want to become a bridge for developing medical science and spreading the culture of China and Africa."
