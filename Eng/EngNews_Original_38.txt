Train attendants prepare for trial operation of Nairobi-Mombasa railway - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Around 120 African train attendants underwent intensive training and are expected to start work in June when a rail line linking Kenya's capital Nairobi with Mombasa, the biggest port in east Africa, undergoes a trial operation.
Being a key construction project under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, it was the first railway built by a Chinese company with Chinese standard and technology in Africa.
The line is about 480km long and is designed for passenger trains running 120 km per hour and freight trains at 80 km per hour. And the track will shorten the journey between the two cities from 12 to four or five hours.
