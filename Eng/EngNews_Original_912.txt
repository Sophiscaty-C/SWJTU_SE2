Chinese company launches a smoke reducing stove accessory - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Shengzhou Stove Manufacturer on Wednesday launched a wood cook stove accessory that helps to reduce smoke and improve burning efficiency, either in open fires, traditional stoves or the company's wood-burning rocket stoves.
Dubbed Jet-Frame, the accessory has a fan that blows powerful jets of air underneath the fire, through the charcoal and into the flames, creating intense heat and very little smoke.
Speaking during the launch event at a Nairobi hotel, Wang Chenkai, the company's division business manager, said the accessory can reduce up to 80 percent of the smoke and save up to 60 percent of fuel.
"Jet-flame can be used as a stand-alone addition to an open fire or traditional stove or as an add-on accessory to our wood-burning rocket stoves," Wang said.
The accessory is usually connected to a USB power supply while in use and retails for $10.
"The product is affordable and we believe it will greatly help developing countries in reducing open fires emissions," Wang said.
