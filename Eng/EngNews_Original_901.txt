Kenya launches three major China-built infrastructures - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Kenya maintained its lead in regional infrastructure development after launching three major infrastructure projects on Wednesday.
President Uhuru Kenyatta flagged off the passenger train plying the newly-completed 120km Nairobi-Naivasha standard gauge railway. The infrastructure, built at a cost of $1.48 billion and extension of the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, would see freight from the port delivered to the inland port, which is valued at $69 million.
Upon completion, the dry port is expected to become a distribution center for goods transported by the standard rail to regional countries such as Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The president noted that together with the planned special economic zone, the infrastructure will revolutionize the rural economy of the surrounding area.
Kenya Railways Company said the new railway line would provide an efficient railway network and transport for both passengers and goods, decongest the port of Mombasa, lower production costs and provide better access to markets while attracting additional foreign investment into the country.
"It provides a viable transportation solution in the region, which will ensure seamless connectivity that will enhance regional integration," said the government agency.
He also unveiled the 27km Jomo Kenyatta International Airport-James Gichuru Road Expressway project. The four-lane dual carriageway is expected to ease congestion on the main Mombasa-Nairobi road that links the international airport to downtown Nairobi.
The expressway will have 10 interchanges, including the SGR terminus at JKIA, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass and Enterprise Road.
