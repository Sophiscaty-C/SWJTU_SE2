President Xi meets leader of Sao Tome and Principe - Chinadaily.com.cn
 

Xi made the remarks while meeting with the prime minister of Sao Tome and Principe, Patrice Trovoada, who arrived in China on Wednesday for a six-day official visit.
As the bilateral ties between the two countries enter a new chapter, Xi said that China is willing to establish a comprehensive partnership based on equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation.
Trovoada became his country's first prime minister to visit Beijing after the resumption of diplomatic relations in late December. 
The resumption came one week after the African nation cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Xi spoke highly of Trovoada's contributions to the resumption of diplomatic ties between the two countries. The two nations should understand and support each other on core interests and major concerns, he said.
China is willing to help Sao Tome and Principe improve its development plans, boost cooperation in tourism, fishery and agriculture, and support the country's infrastructure construction, use of human resources and security capacity building, Xi said.
The Chinese president also said the two countries should increase people-to-people communication on education, culture, medicine, media, youth and women to strengthen the friendship. 
China is willing to cooperate with Sao Tome and Principe on security including fighting pirates and cross-border organized crime, he added.
The president pointed out that China would like to support the development of African nations, help them achieve sustainable development, and jointly build the China-Africa community of shared destiny.
Sao Tome and Principe firmly upholds the one-China policy, Trovoada said, adding that the resumption of diplomatic ties won wide support in his country.
Sao Tome and Principe is willing to enhance cooperation with China on economy and trade, infrastructure, tourism and security, he said.
