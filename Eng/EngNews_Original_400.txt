WUHAN - A new direct flight will be launched between Wuhan City in Central China's Hubei province and Mauritius, the provincial government said on Friday.
The flight, run by an Airbus A340-300 aircraft and operated by Air Mauritius, will take off every Saturday.
Outbound flights will depart from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport at 1:05 am Beijing time and arrive in Mauritius at 7:40 am local time. The return flights will leave Mauritius at 8:15 am local time and arrive in Wuhan at 11:05 pm Beijing time.
