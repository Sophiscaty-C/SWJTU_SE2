Residents laud Chinese contractor's work - Chinadaily.com.cn
Residents of Kiawara area in Kenya's Nyeri county have lauded the work of China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which is constructing a 35-kilometer road in the area.
CMEC is constructing a road network from Kiawara to Nairutia at a cost of Ksh1.23 billion ($12.1 million), which will connect with another road running from Karai to Babito being built by a local company.
The two roads were officially commissioned Feb 23, 2018 by Kenya's Deputy President William Ruto, who said the government was committed to having an improved road network in the country. However, the construction work started last year.
Barely three months since CMEC started the projects, it has already completed 3 kilometers.
