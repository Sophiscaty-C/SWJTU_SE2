Algerian FM vows to crack case of Chinese citizen's murder - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
ALGIERS - Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel vowed Thursday to solve the case of the murder of a Chinese citizen in Algiers following the Chinese embassy's representation on the matter.
The minister expressed his shock and grief to Chinese Ambassador to Algeria Yang Guangyu, while asking Yang to convey the condolences of the Algerian government to the family of the deceased, the Chinese embassy said in a statement on its website.
A Chinese citizen was robbed and killed on Sunday by several knife-wielding criminals in broad daylight in the region of Dalbeda in Algiers.
On Wednesday, Yang met with Algerian Foreign Ministry's General Director Mohamed Bensabri, who is in charge of foreigners' affair in Algeria, to discuss the case.
Yang expressed serious concern to the Algerian side over the murder, adding that the crime is appalling and has caused great shock and indignation among the Chinese citizens in Algeria.
The Chinese envoy also urged Algeria to attach greater importance to the safety of the Chinese citizens in Algeria and take strong measures to protect them.
Several provinces in Algeria recently have witnessed cases of armed robberies and burglaries against Chinese companies and personnel, resulting in varying degrees of personal injures and property damages.
The Chinese embassy on Tuesday issued a statement on its website, alerting Chinese citizens in the North African country to take further safety precautions following the fatal robbery.
