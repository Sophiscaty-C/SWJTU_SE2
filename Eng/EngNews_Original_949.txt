Ethiopia, China agree to boost cooperation on construction sector - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
ADDIS ABABA -- The Ethiopia Ministry of Urban Development and Construction (MoUDC) on Wednesday disclosed it has agreed with its Chinese firms to boost cooperation in the construction sector.
In a press statement, MoUDC said the construction cooperation agreement was reached in China between Aysha Mohammed, visiting Ethiopia Minister of Urban Development and Construction, and officials of Chinese state-owned construction firms.
&quot;Ethiopia has put a 10-year strategic plan to exponentially develop the construction sector. Chinese construction firms have a key role in helping fulfill Ethiopia's 10-year strategic plan,&quot; Mohammed was quoted as saying.
She further said Ethiopia is keen to receive Chinese assistance in the east African country's drive to build residential homes for millions of Ethiopians who lack proper housing facilities.
Ethiopia, which has been recording strong economic growth for the last 15 years partly powered by a boom in the construction, is undertaking housing projects to fulfill the economic and social needs of its rapidly urbanizing population.
Earlier this month, Takele Uma, mayor of Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa announced plans to partner with Chinese firms to ease acute residential housing shortage in the city of about four million people.
The residential housing project which will lie on 27 hectares of land will be built by China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).
CCCC is a major construction player in Ethiopia, taking part in landmark projects, including the 216 km Woldiya-Mekelle railway project, the Addis Ababa ring road project, the 78 km Addis Ababa-Adama toll expressway and extension of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport.
The Addis Ababa City Administration and CCCC are currently finalizing design works and pre- construction modalities for the proposed residential housing project.
