Officials from China's Public Health and Customs Departments, as well as experts, will hold a video conference with African officials and experts on Wednesday to share information and exchange experience on the novel coronavirus epidemic, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday.
African officials and experts from the Africa Centers for Disease and Control and more than 20 African countries will participate, Geng told reporters at a regular press conference in Beijing.
Noting that the epidemic situation in Africa is severe as confirmed cases have been reported in many African countries, Geng said China will continue to provide assistance within its ability and put into place health cooperation under the framework of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.
China has already provided a batch of detection reagents and material supplies to some African countries, and the Chinese medical teams sent to asset Africa also are engaging in local epidemic control work, Geng said.
