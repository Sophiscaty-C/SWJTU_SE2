President Xi Jinping sent congratulations on Sunday to the opening of the leaders' meeting of the 31st African Union Summit in Nouakchott, capital of Mauritania.
Hailing the African Union as a model of the continent's unity and self-development, Xi said the organization has actively pushed forward its integration process.
Xi said member nations have continued to speak with one voice on major international and regional issues and have continued to increase their ability to safeguard peace and security.
He said he hopes the African Union can guide African countries to achieve more progress.
The president also said he expects to meet with African leaders during the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September. He also hopes to discuss plans for China-Africa cooperation and development, thus benefiting the people of both sides and contributing to world peace and development.
The FOCAC summit in Beijing is themed as win-win cooperation and joining hands to build a closer community with a shared future for China and Africa.
China will work with African countries to link the theme of the summit with the joint development of the Belt and Road Initiative between China and Africa, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations, the Agenda 2063 of the African Union as well as the development strategies of various African countries to push forward the China-Africa comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level, Xi added.
