<strong>President makes first visit by a Chinese head of state to the African country</strong>
China and Rwanda signed a number of cooperation documents covering such areas as investment, finance, e-commerce and law enforcement on Monday during President Xi Jinping's state visit, the first by a Chinese head of state to the African country.
The signing ceremony was witnessed by Xi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame. Before the signing ceremony, Kagame hosted a grand ceremony to welcome Xi and had a meeting with the Chinese president.
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 47 years ago, China and Rwanda have treated each other as equals with sincerity and friendship, Xi said.
Xi recalled that during Kagame's visit to China in March 2017, they had an in-depth exchange of views on advancing bilateral ties and cooperation for mutual benefits, adding that their consensus has seen comprehensive implementation.
