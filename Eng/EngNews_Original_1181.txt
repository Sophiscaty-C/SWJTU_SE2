Magufuli, who named the interchange as Kijazi Interchange in appreciation of the former Chief Secretary John Kijazi who died on Feb 17, 2021, commended CCECC for completing the project on time.
He urged other construction companies undertaking various projects in the country to emulate the aptitude displayed by the Chinese company.
