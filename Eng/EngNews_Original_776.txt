MUKONO, Uganda -- Uganda has formed two committees to follow up commitments made during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) summit held in Beijing last September, a top government official here said on Friday.
Uganda's Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda said during a tour of the Chinese-owned Tian Tang Industrial Park in the central district of Mukono that the committees, one technical and the other supervisory, have started their work with the aim of identifying opportunities.
The technical committee, according to Rugunda, will look at the trade and investment opportunities while the supervisory committee headed by former minister of finance Ezra Suruma will play an oversight role.
Zhao Xiufen, Economic and Commercial Counselor at the Chinese embassy, said the embassy is working with Uganda government officials to harness the opportunities announced during the FOCAC summit.
During the FOCAC summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced eight major initiatives to boost China-Africa cooperation.
