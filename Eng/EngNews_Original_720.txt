More Chinese tourists heading to South Africa - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
South Africa, along with other countries of Africa, has become a new popular overseas traveling destination for Chinese tourists, driven by their increasing spending power and demand of unique and in-depth travel experiences.
From April to September last year, 72,882 Chinese travelers visited South Africa, and the percent of visitors added was 8.6 percent year-on-year, according to figures provided by South Africa Tourism.
From January to June 2018, the average length of stay of Chinese travelers in South Africa reached 10 days, which is 66 percent longer than the same period in 2017. During the period, the money spent by Chinese travelers in the country surged by 187 percent over the same period the previous year.
The year 2018 marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of former South African president Nelson Mandela, and many Chinese travelers took signature trips to follow Mandela's footsteps and experience the 100 significant moments of his lifetime journey.
"We would like to provide more luxurious experiences for middle-class Chinese tourists, and promote more of our authentic culture, adventurous features and human-centered experiences, to cater to their increasingly diversified demand," said Mansoor Mohamed, chief Asia representative of South Africa Tourism.
"South Africa is a memorable African region with prolific wildlife, breathtaking landscapes and remnants of ancient culture. This year, the number of Chinese tourists who visit South Africa is expected to continue to boom," he said.
