Ambassador on BRI and what it brings to Tanzania - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Mbelwa Kairuki, the Tanzanian ambassador to China, recently talked with China Daily on China's policies on trade and investment, as well as the Belt and Road Initiative.
Kairuki thinks highly of China's development in the past 70 years since the founding of the new China and said many developing countries have benefited a lot from its progress, especially in agriculture, science and technology, and medicine.
The ambassador was impressed by China's recent efforts to facilitate foreign investment, and how China has opened up more to international investors, particularly in the past 10 years. Many of the Tanzanian businessmen in China are based in Guangdong province, where they set up their trade companies, exporting inexpensive consumer goods, furniture and electronics to their homeland in Africa.
Ever since Tanzania's participation in the BRI, bilateral exchanges have been on the rise, with more Tanzanians studying in China as well as Chinese working and traveling in Tanzania.
There are also many infrastructure projects between the two countries under the BRI, such as the construction of the road linking Tanzania's former capital Dar es Salaam with the northern city of Kagera. Previously, people traveling between the two cities had to transit through a third country.
Near the end of the conversation, the ambassador said the BRI is a platform that enables the participating countries to build a more sustainable, collaborative and inclusive world.
