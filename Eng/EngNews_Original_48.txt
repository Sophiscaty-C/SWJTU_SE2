&quot;Sino-Kenya cooperation in various fields has gained momentum over the years, and it is the very reason why we are holding the China Trade Week in Nairobi for the third time,&quot; Wang said.
He noted that the exhibition will provide an opportunity for Kenyan entrepreneurs to grow strong business partnerships with Chinese companies and also benefit from the industrial capacity and wealth of knowledge from China.
