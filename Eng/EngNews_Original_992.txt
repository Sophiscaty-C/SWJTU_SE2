Chinese companies donate food to Kenyan students to fight COVID-19 - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
The Kenya-China Economic and Trade Association donated food to a primary school on April 9 in Kenya's capital Nairobi to help teachers and students resist the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Located in Mathare, the second-largest slum in Nairobi, the Mcedo Beijing Primary School was built in 2007 with a donation from the Chinese Embassy in Kenya.
Under the initiative of the Chinese Embassy in 2012, KCETA donated more than 4 million yuan ($568,861) to implement the second phase of the expansion project, which increased the number of students from 360 to 526.
In order to help students complete their studies smoothly, representatives of the Kenya China Economic and Trade Association visit the school regularly to understand the needs of students and provide assistance.
