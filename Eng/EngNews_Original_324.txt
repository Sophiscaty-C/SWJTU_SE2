JOHANNESBURG - A group of 50 South African special economic zones (SEZ) practitioners and supporting sector specialists will receive some training in the filed in China from May 31 to June 7.
The officials from South Africa's Department of Trade and Industry, provincial departments and local municipalities and agencies responsible for the implementation of the SEZ will participate in the capacity building program on the SEZs in Tianjin.
Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry Bulelani Magwanishe said the training is to equip practitioners with the technical know-how on the planning, development, management and operations of special economic zones.
"The program is important to ensure that all stakeholders have the technical know-how required for the successful development of the SEZs in South Africa," said Magwanishe.
"One of the major challenges that government has identified in relation to the development of the SEZs as part of the implementation of our SEZ program is the capacity constraint," said Magwanishe.
"This is the fifth group of our officials to be trained in China as part of the implementation of our agreement on the SEZ program," said Magwanishe.
The South African government has expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for the opportunity to equip their officials with knowledge, information and skills related to the roll-out of the SEZ program.
Magwanishe said it is necessary for the country to have a pool of skilled and trained officials to successfully implement the SEZ program.
South Africa wants to use the SEZs to accelerate industrialization and promote economic growth, address unemployment and poverty.
