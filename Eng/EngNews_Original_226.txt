The Congratulatory Message of President Uhuru Kenyatta to President Xi Jinping - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
On behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya and on my own behalf, I wish to extend my warmest congratulations on Your Excellency's re-election as President of the People's Republic of China.
Your re-election has fully demonstrated the strong confidence of the Chinese people in your vision and wisdom in the governance of China and international affairs. I believe, under your wise and strong leadership, China will certainly become an even stronger and more prosperous country, and make greater contributions to peace, stability and prosperity of the world.
I am pleased and proud to note that over the past few years Kenya-China relations have advanced by leaps and bounds, and our bilateral cooperation has scored tremendous achievements, the Standard Gauge Railway in particular, that are significantly improving the lives of millions of Kenyans.
I believe the coming years will mark another milestone in the development of our bilateral relations, and I look forward to working more closely with Your Excellency to push forward our Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership for further accomplishments.
