An international conference on country governance and socio-economic development in China and Africa was held in Pretoria, the capital city of South Africa, on Tuesday.
More than 200 representatives from key research institutions, policymaking departments, and enterprises from both China and Africa attended the conference and held in-depth discussions on a wide range of topics, including governance capacity-building, urbanization, social policies, industrial development, and innovation.
They wish to draw wisdom from each other's ancient civilizations and the best practices of development to promote common prosperity and development of China and Africa.
Xie Fuzhan, president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in a keynote speech that China has achieved rapid economic development and long-term social stability over the past 70 years. Over the past four decades, China also has been expanding its opening-up, adhering to the path of peaceful development and actively integrating itself into the world.
The main reason for the great achievements is that China has been strengthening and improving its national governance, and now China can share those experiences with the world, he said.
"It is of great significance for China and Africa to strengthen the exchanges of governance and development experience, which could help promote the common prosperity and development of China and Africa's economy and society," he said.
The conference was sponsored by the China-Africa Institute and the Human Sciences Research Council of South Africa and organized by the council and the Bureau of International Cooperation of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
