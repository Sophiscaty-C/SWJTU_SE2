More deals expected in second China-Kenya expo - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
China International Exhibition Center Group Corporation has announced that the second China-Kenya Industrial Capacity Cooperation Exposition (China-Kenya Expo) will be held on Nov 14-17 at the Kenyatta International Convention Center in Nairobi.
In a press briefing on Thursday, the organizer said at least 81 mega enterprises from China have confirmed participation in the annual event sponsored by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and China Africa Development Fund in collaboration with Kenya's Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives, Kenya Investment Authority, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and the Kenya Private Sector Association.
There is a 20 percent surge in the number of exhibitors this year leading to the expansion of exhibiting space by 40 percent. "Last year's event was successful. There were at least two deals signed between a Chinese manufacturer and local dealer valued at $3 million," said Miao Ligang, department manager of CIEC adding that more deals are expected to be drawn this year.
The expo is set to provide a unique platform for both governmental and private sectors from the two countries to cooperate on infrastructure, energy, machinery and equipment, agricultural processing machinery, information and communication technology as well as transportation and logistics said Miao.
In his remarks, Guo Ce, the economic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese embassy in Kenya, urged the government to further improve its investment environment to accelerate inflows of foreign investments. "Kenya can borrow lessons from China's reform and opening up initiative that is behind the meteoric economic growth of the second largest economy in the world," he said.
The expo will be the first large-scale event held in Africa after the Beijing Forum on China-Africa Cooperation Summit.
