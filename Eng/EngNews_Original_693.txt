Chinese firms scout talent at Kenyan university - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
The Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi on Tuesday successfully held a third job fair on campus in Kenya's capital city.
More than 20 Chinese companies participated in the event, with representatives discussing job opportunities in their fields with graduates. Participating companies included popular mobile manufacturer Techno Mobile and Amanbo, an e-commerce platform, among many others.
According to Isaac Mbeche, the acting deputy vice-chancellor of administration and finance at the university, the events have been successful.
"I hope that our graduates will find space for their talents and more companies can find the talents they need and reserve them," he said.
The Confucius Institute previously held the event in March and December 2017. Besides being a platform to promote cultural exchanges, it is an opportunity for Chinese firms to develop links with local universities, the Institute said.
This comes at the back of a recent report indicating African students are applying for jobs they are not qualified for. Released on Dec 13, the research, conducted by Ringer One Africa Media Group, said close to 90 percent of applicants that apply for a job position are objectively not a match for the role advertised. This is caused less by a shortage of jobs, but a fundamental misunderstanding of job requirements, both from employers and candidates.
