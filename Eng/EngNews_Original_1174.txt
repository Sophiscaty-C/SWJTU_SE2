Zimbabwean president says China's achievements under CPC leadership 'tremendous beyond belief" - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
HARARE -- The strides the Communist Party of China (CPC) has made over the past decades are "tremendous beyond belief," said Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa here on Friday.
Congratulating on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC this year, Mnangagwa said in an interview with Chinese media at the State House in Harare that despite enduring trying times, the party has been focusing on its goal of making life better for its people.
"China has gone through very hard times historically," he said. Under the CPC's leadership, however, "China has achieved strides of both economic and social progress."
Mnangagwa praised the fruitful cooperation in various areas between the CPC and Zimbabwe's ruling party ZANU-PF, affirming that both sides will continue to work closely together.
"There is a lot for ZANU-PF to learn from the achievements by the Communist Party of China," the Zimbabwean president said, noting that the two sides enjoy continuous communication and have worked together to take on challenges.
With decades of amity, the relationship between the ZANU-PF and the CPC has remained steadfast.
Mnangagwa highlighted China's growing support for Zimbabwe's economic development, saying Zimbabwe is grateful for the booming cooperation with China under the CPC's leadership.
As a country that is still in its early stages of development, he said, Zimbabwe has much to learn from China in infrastructure development and technological advancement.
"We still need to send our students, our young people, boys and girls, to China to learn these technologies that are there today," Mnangagwa said.
"All we need is not to invent the wheel, but to go and learn from our friends in China, for us to leapfrog and catch up with other countries," he added.
