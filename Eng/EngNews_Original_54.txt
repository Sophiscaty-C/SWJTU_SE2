&quot;The Chinese with a short space of time have done what the EU and the United States failed to do over years in terms of skills transfer and some of the things we never dreamed we will have ... The Chinese have brought a new kind of partnership where they impart skills for our future use on our own,&quot; said Jiyane.
He said the relationship with the Chinese have been very cordial while hailing the mutual learning between Transnet and CRRC.

&quot;The global economy is currently facing difficulties and we are exploring news areas of cooperation. We are thinking of using new models like leasing the locomotive since some do not have money to buy in current environment,&quot; said Wang.
Both executives confirmed that there have been frequent visits of employees of both companies on exchange programs and share knowledge, skills and good practice.
