The Fifth China-Africa People's Forum will help promote the building of a community with shared future for China and Africa, and serve as a warm-up for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in September, an official with a nongovernmental organization said on Friday.
The people's forum, to be held in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province, on July 23 and 24, will also further consolidate the foundation of China-Africa friendship from social and people-to-people perspectives, said Zhu Rui, secretary-general of China NGO Network for International Exchanges.
The forum, jointly hosted by the network and the Sichuan provincial government, will carry the theme of pooling the power of the people and promoting China-Africa friendship and mutual trust, he said at a media briefing.
It will also host in-depth discussions on how NGOs can play to their unique advantages and play an important role to promote China-Africa friendship and cooperation, and to push forward the building of a community with shared future for China and Africa, he added.
About 100 representatives, including those from the NGO, think tanks and the media, from more than 30 African countries will take part in the meeting.
The first four sessions of China-Africa People's Forum were held in Nairobi of Kenya in 2011, Suzhou of China in 2012, Khartoum of Sudan in 2014 and Yiwu of China in 2015.
