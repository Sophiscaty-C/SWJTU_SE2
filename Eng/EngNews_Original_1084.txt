China shares development experience with Africa - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Africa regards China's development as an opportunity for the world rather than a threat to it, said former senior South African diplomat Gert Johannes Grobler. China's strong opposition to hegemony, unilateralism, protectionism and trade bullying are appreciated by the continent and the developing world at large, he added.
Grobler, who served as South Africa's ambassador to Spain, Japan and Madagascar and is now a senior research fellow at the Institute of African Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, was speaking at the online Vision China event organized by China Daily on Wednesday.
&quot;China is making significant and growing contributions to global economic growth, peace and stability … its consistent position that it will not seek progress at the expense of others is appreciated by Africa and the developing world,&quot; Grobler said.
He also said China's growth model and success have inspired and given confidence to other developing countries in their efforts to achieve development and enhance prosperity.
&quot;China is prepared to share its expertise and experiences with other countries that want to speed up their economic growth and development, and enable them to choose a development path in accordance with their own national conditions and requirements,&quot; he said.
