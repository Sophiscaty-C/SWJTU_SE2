<strong>Kenya should make more efforts to identify its competitive edge, diplomat tells cooperation forum</strong>
Chinese investors in Kenya are considering strategies that would align their investments with prioritized government projects under the African country's Big Four development agenda.
The agenda, spearheaded by President Uhuru Kenyatta, aims to scale up the share of the manufacturing sector from 5 percent to 15 percent of GDP and generate 1.3 million jobs targeting youths; achieve universal healthcare coverage; build at least 500,000 affordable homes; and strengthen food security.
During the one-day First Forum on China-Kenya Cooperation, held in Nairobi and sponsored by the Kenya Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Ken-Invest, the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, representatives of the Chinese private sector in Kenya - estimated at 400 companies - said they are eager to invest in opportunities offered by the government's prioritized programs.
According to Guo Ce, the economic and commercial counselor of the Chinese embassy in Kenya, the Chinese hope to increase their investments in the country.
"We want to grow together," he told the forum, adding that the large trade deficit between the two countries in favor of China is a result of market dynamics of demand and supply.
Guo emphasized that China is eager to build a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship with the regional governmental organization East African Community and, as a result, has been promoting programs such as people-to-people exchanges as well as cultural and training initiatives that have seen more than 500 young people and civil servants receive training in China.
"The master's and doctoral degree programs have seen an uptick in the number of Kenyan students undertaking programs in prestigious Chinese universities under the government scholarships."
