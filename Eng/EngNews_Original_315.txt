Chinese ambassador calls for promoting common development with Namibia - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
WINDHOEK - Chinese Ambassador to Namibia Zhang Yiming has called for building a community of common destiny between Namibia and China by jointly promoting the Belt and Road Initiative.
Cooperation between Namibia and China has huge potential, especially in mining, agriculture, infrastructure, manufacturing and tourism, Zhang told Xinhua in a recent interview.
The diplomat hailed Namibia's social and political stability and rich natural resources, saying it has exceptional advantages for joining the Belt and Road Initiative.
The initiative, proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013, comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and is aimed at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes.
Highlighting the friendship between Namibia and China, Zhang said the pragmatic cooperation "has driven into a fast lane" since the two countries elevated the bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation in March when Namibian President Hage Geingob visited China.
Chinese investments in Namibia have reached almost $6 billion and China is actively engaged in the country's infrastructure and human resources development, according to Zhang.
He said that China will promote the docking of the two countries' policies and development plans, and support Namibia's industrialization and agricultural modernization, as well as help it reduce poverty and unemployment.
