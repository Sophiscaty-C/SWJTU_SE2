Zambia refutes report of Chinese firms taking over public assets due to debt - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
LUSAKA -- The Zambian Government on Saturday refuted a media report that it was in talks with Chinese companies for the latter to take over public institutions due to debt.
Chief government spokesperson Dora Siliya tweeted a denial of the report that said the government was seeking to sell some public assets, pointing out that some of the China-funded projects had not even been completed.
&quot;Govt's position is that all stories relating to sale or takeover of public assets such (as) ZNBC (state broadcaster), Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, and ZESCO (power utility) by China are false,&quot; she said on Twitter.
&quot;ZNBC digital migration and KK AIRPORT projects not even complete yet. How then can one refer to loan default in view of grace periods?&quot; she asked.
Last week, the African Confidential fortnightly reported that talks were underway for a Chinese firm to take over Zambia's power utility due to debt.
