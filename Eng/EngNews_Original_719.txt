Agreement signed to study Asia-Africa power grid plan - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
A China-led organization will help promote a project to connect some power grids between Asia and Africa, and plan to complete the feasibility study this year.
Global Energy Interconnection Development Cooperation Organization, initiated by China, the Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity of Ethiopia, and the Gulf Cooperation Council Interconnection Authority signed an agreement over the weekend to jointly work on the Ethiopia-Gulf Interconnection project.
According to the agreement, the three parties will conduct research on the necessity, economy, business model and possible transmission route.
They will establish a joint working group to complete the project's pre-feasibility study within 12 months. Ethiopia is rich in hydropower resources, most of which remain untapped.
According to GEIDCO, through grid interconnection, clean hydropower from Ethiopia can be transmitted to the Gulf countries, which can help turn resource advantages in Africa into economic advantages.
In addition, the project also can help to meet the demand for electricity during the summer peak season of power consumption in the Gulf region, cut down the electricity tariff and save energy costs.
The move was a major part of the global energy interconnection. As a combination of smart grid, ultra high voltage grid and clean energy, GEI represents a modern energy system that is dominated by clean energy, centered on electricity and featured with a high level of connectivity, co-development and sharing.
