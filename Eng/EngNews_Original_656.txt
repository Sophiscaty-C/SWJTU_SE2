Botswana's minister hails Chinese construction project - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
GABORONE - The Sidilega Private Hospital, being constructed by a Chinese company in the capital, is marvelous, said a Botswana minister Tuesday.
Alfred Madigele, Botswana's health and wellness minister, said he is certain that the construction by the Red East Construction Ltd will be completed within the planned budget and the hospital will be handed over on time.
According to Madigele, the construction of the 110-bed hospital is expected to be completed in March 2019.
It will be the third private hospital in the capital and will reduce the overcrowding in the two existing ones and the state owned hospitals, he said.
Sharkil Rasul, executive director of the hospital, said the hospital will be equipped with advanced facilities to enhance the service quality for patients.
He said the hospital will introduce 24-hour laboratory and pathology services as well as 24-hour pharmacy.
Steven Zhang, a senior worker of the Red East Construction Ltd, said they had completed several large projects in the country, including the Broadhurst Magistrate Court.
As part of its social responsibility, the Chinese company has always trained local laborers on skills they lack in their job, said Zhang.
