China to provide S Sudan with financial, food aid amid famine: envoy - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Given the severity of famine facing South Sudan, China has also decided to provide 8,750 tons of food through bilateral channels to assist the country, said Wu Haitao, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN at a Security Council meeting.
Since July last year, the security, economic and humanitarian situation has worsened markedly and no part of the country is immune from conflict, David Shearer, special representative of UN Secretary-General in South Sudan briefed the council earlier.
After hearing Shearer's briefing, Wu said that &quot;the political settlement is the only way out for the issue of South Sudan.&quot;
He called on the international community to contribute to efforts for all parties in South Sudan to abandon military means, cease hostilities and immediately get back to the track of political settlement.
Wu also said &quot;it is important for the Security Council to send out more positive and enthusiastic messages.&quot;
He said the council must encourage all parties in South Sudan to actively engage in the dialogue process to stay committed to peace, stability, and development.
&quot;The international community must provide timely and effective assistance, to assist South Sudanese people to overcome their current difficulties,&quot; he added.
South Sudan has been shattered by a civil war that broke out in December 2013. A peace deal signed in August 2015 led to the formation of a transitional unity government in April but was again devastated by fresh violence in July 2016.
Tens of thousands of South Sudanese have been killed, with more than 2 million displaced and another 4.6 million left severely food insecure since December 2013.
