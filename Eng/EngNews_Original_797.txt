Chongqing municipal government signed an agreement with Ethiopian Airlines Group on Saturday to launch three regular freight routes, which will be China's longest regular freight routes, on the sidelines of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.
The three routes between Chongqing in southwestern China and Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, comprise one direct route, one with a stopover in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, and one with a stopover in New Delhi in India.
"They will not only connect Chongqing and Ethiopia, but also connect Asia, Africa and South America and effectively match the cargo demand of Chongqing for delivery of products to the Middle East, India, Africa, South America and other markets," said Ahmed Shide, minister of finance of Ethiopia.
"I strongly believe this cooperation will strengthen economic and trade exchanges between the two countries and benefit Ethiopian people as well."
High-tech products and fresh food are expected to the major freight transported on the routes, added Chen Gang, director of Marketing and Planning of Chinese Mainland in Ethiopian Airlines.
Chongqing is building itself into an international logistics hub in the hinterlands. "Chongqing now has 14 international freight routes, with the largest freight volume in western China," said Wu Cunrong, deputy mayor of Chongqing. "The new flight corridor will help boost the cooperation between Chongqing and countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiatives."
