African diplomats visit CPPCC museum - Chinadaily.com.cn
About 50 African ambassadors and diplomats to China and representatives of the African Union to China paid a visit to the Museum of the History of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Tuesday to better learn about China's political system.
After the tour, they met with officials from the CPPCC to learn about the work of the 13th CPPCC and its foreign exchanges.
"Through today's visiting trip, I know that in China's political system, people from all walks of life can communicate each other equally, which is an important and good experience for African countries," said Martin Mpana, ambassador of the Republic of Cameroon to China.
Rahamtalla Mohamed Elnor, a representative from the African Union to China, said, "China's political system and the achievements of China's reform and opening-up over the past 40 years have all provided great experience for Africa."
"China and Africa have long shared a common destiny, and we hope that China and Africa will join hands to achieve win-win cooperation," he added.
Babindamana Aimee, the Congo's ambassador to China, said, "I am very happy to be invited to this tour to the museum. It's a good chance for me to learn the history of the CPPCC, so I took down a lot of notes."
