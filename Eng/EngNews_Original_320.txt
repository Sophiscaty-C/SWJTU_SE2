China, Burkina Faso resume diplomatic ties - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
China and Burkina Faso resumed diplomatic relations on Saturday, after the West African country severed “diplomatic ties” with Taiwan on Thursday.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Burkina Faso’s Foreign Minister Alpha Barry signed a joint communique on the re-establishment of diplomatic relations in Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.
Barry said on Thursday in the capital city of Ouagadougou that Burkina Faso has broken off ties with Taiwan and will close its embassy in Taipei, Xinhua reported.
China appreciated Burkina Faso’s decision to cut its “diplomatic ties” with Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said.
This is a correct decision made by the Burkina Faso government, in keeping with the trend of the times and the world, he said.
“We welcome Burkina Faso to join in the China-Africa gathering of friendly cooperation as soon as possible on the basis of the one-China principle,” he added.
