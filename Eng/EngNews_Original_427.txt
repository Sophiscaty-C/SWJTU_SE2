The rapid development of bilateral ties shows that China-Africa cooperation is deepening and is a model of solidarity and collaboration among major developing countries, Xi said.
The key to the fruitful outcomes resulting from the relationship between the two nations lies in the fact that both sides have been helping, respecting, trusting and benefiting each other, and understanding, befriending and relying on each other, Xi said.
He urged the two countries to strengthen mutual trust, always be frank and stand together, continue unleashing their growth potential and promote quality and pragmatic cooperation to better benefit their people.
The two countries should enhance understanding, friendship and exchanges between their people, continue to support each other in international affairs, strengthen high-level strategic coordination and work together for a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind, he said.
Ramaphosa said Xi's visit shows South Africa-China ties have transcended ordinary bilateral relations and are at their highest point in history.
South Africa will work with China to deepen cooperation in areas including trade, culture, and science and technology, and continue to promote the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations, he said.
