The Communist Party of China (CPC) on Tuesday started off a two-day conference with Africa's influential political parties in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, aimed at deepening discussion and exchange on governance philosophy and development.
The CPC brought together more than 40 political parties from over 36 countries.
The event, themed "Theories and Practices of Chinese and African Political Parties in Exploring Development Paths Suitable to National Situations", was held outside China for the first time.
Tanzanian President John Magufuli, in opening the conference, thanked China for having the dialogue, terming it a path toward peace, security and economic growth in Africa.
"Political parties play a critical role in economic development of any country. They are the voices of the citizens. I'm confident that the outcomes of the conference will not only enhance the relationship between African countries' political parties and the CPC but will also see deliberations on how Africa can attain sustainable economic growth," he said.
The president said Africa will achieve more economic growth when nations opt to work together.
