China-Africa partnership 'open and inclusive': Foreign Minister - Chinadaily.com.cn
Criticism that China has established a debt trap in Africa, or practices neo-colonialism in the continent, should not be considered seriously, as Chinese-African cooperation is open and inclusive, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi sad.
Wang made the comments at a news conference from the sidelines of the annual legislative session on Friday.
China-Africa relations have never been better, and China has demonstrated a role model for international cooperation with Africa, Wang said.
Going forward China and Africa will work together to implement the eight major initiatives announced by President Xi Jinping at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and build even an stronger Chinese-African community with a shared future, he said.
He called on the international community to increase input in Africa to promote development of the continent.
