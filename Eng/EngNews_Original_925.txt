Manaouda made the remarks during a ceremony to bid farewell to the 19th Chinese medical mission and welcome the 20th.
Chinese doctors have made &quot;significant contribution in the care of the Cameroonian populations and in the transfer of knowledge for the benefit of our health personnel,&quot; Manaouda said.
Wang Yingwu, Chinese ambassador to Cameroon, said that &quot;the Chinese party is willing to further strengthen cooperation&quot; with Cameroon in terms of public health in order to implement the health care initiative of the eight major initiatives proposed at the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.
