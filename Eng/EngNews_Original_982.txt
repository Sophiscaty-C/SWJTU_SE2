Jack Ma Foundation helps Africa as coronavirus cases rise - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Jack Ma, Chinese business magnate, investor and philanthropist, has said the Jack Ma Foundation will donate to each one of the 54 African nations 20,000 coronavirus testing kits, 100,000 masks and 1,000 medical use protective suits and face shields.
In a statement released on Monday, Jack Ma reiterated his belief that Africa can be one step ahead of the virus.
"We cannot ignore the potential risk to Africa and assume this continent of 1.3 billion people will blissfully escape this crisis," Ma said in the statement. "The world cannot afford the unthinkable consequences of a COVID-19 pandemic in Africa."
Ma added that his foundation will immediately start working with medical institutions in Africa to provide online training material for coronavirus clinical treatment.
Acknowledging the donation earlier on Sunday, Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia's prime minister who has been selected by the Jack Ma Foundation to manage the logistics and distribution of the supplies to other African countries, thanked Ma for the package which was to benefit all African countries.
The Chinese government and Chinese businesses in Africa have continued to offer the much-needed support to member countries as more countries in Africa confirm their first cases of the virus. In a statement released by the Chinese embassy in Kenya after the East African nation confirmed its first case late last week, the embassy said that this is a more important time for countries to step up cooperation and communication to jointly fight the virus.
"The Chinese government has offered 2,000 diagnostic kits to the African Union and stands ready to offer more support and assistance to African countries in need," the embassy said in a statement.
