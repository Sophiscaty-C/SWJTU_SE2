Teaching TCM in Benin is one man's passion - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Tian Tong has been practicing acupuncture for more than 30 years, but the most recent year is particularly special to him: He is helping the people of Benin with traditional Chinese medicine.
A graduate of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Tian had been a TCM clinician at the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University. He specialized in acupucture and massage theraphy.
In December 2019, Tian heard that TCM doctors were needed in a medical assistance team heading to Africa, and he applied without hesitation.
"When we arrived in Porto-Novo in December 2019, TCM wasn't well-known to local residents. While treating Chinese people here in Benin, we also want local residents know more about TCM," Tian said.
Benin is located in West Africa, where the weather is humid. Many people carry heavy loads on their heads.
"Once I met a pregnant woman using her head to carry seafood, weight about 20 kilograms," Tian said. "I was concerned that she might develop problems in her shoulder and neck."
TCM is good for easing pain in his clinic, Tian said, recalling a 42-year-old woman who suffered from lumbago for more than six months before she heard that acupuncture can eliminate back pain and that Tian Tong and his team could help.
Apart from giving clinical treatments, Tian also teaches TCM with an emphasis on acupuncture and massage to local doctors.
"The doctors became increasingly interested in TCM as they saw how we cured patients by using needles," Tian said.
As a member of the 24th group of Chinese medical experts in Benin's capital in December 2019, Tian worked there for more than a year. He is expected to be back to Ningxia in February.
"I hope TCM will benefit more people here in Benin even after I go back to China," Tian said.
