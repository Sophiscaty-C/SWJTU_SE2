Kenyans urged to produce temperate fruit trees - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
Despite Kenya's location in the tropics, it's possible to produce high yields there of temperate trees bearing fruit -- such as apples, pears, peaches, plums and grapes -- if the right technologies and cultivars are used, according to Tao Jianmin, professor of grape planting and breeding at Nanjing Agricultural University.
Tao said the Kenyan climatic conditions, characterized by rainy and dry seasons, are similar to those of Yunnan province, which is currently the highest producer of grapes in China.
He said grapes should be grown in greenhouses to safeguard against diseases and pests, especially during the rainy season. This also ensures two harvests per year.
"I'm willing to partner with local farmers and bring a certain type of cultivar that I bred. It produces bigger-sized and sweeter grapes," he said.
One of the key reasons behind poor development of temperate fruit trees in tropical regions is the lack of a sufficiently cold period to break the trees' dormancy period. Naturally low temperatures, below 7 C, and low light irradiation are required for breaking dormancy.
According to Tao, these challenges can be overcome through breeding fruit cultivars which have low winter chilling requirements and through use of chemicals like hydrogen cyanamide.
"Use of the chemical has played a key role in enabling Yunnan province to increase its grape yields. The chemical can also be used in apples," he said.
Tao gave the remarks during an interview at the conclusion of a one-week course on temperate fruit production under tropical conditions held at Egerton University in Kenya's Nakuru county.
The participants, who included academic staff of local universities, farmers and agricultural extension officers, affirmed that they had acquired vital knowledge on the production of temperate fruit trees.
