The 16th China Medical Team organized by the Zhejiang provincial health department went to the SOS International Children's Village in the Central African Republic earlier this month. Eighteen Chinese doctors and nurses brought medicine and healthcare supplies to more than 100 orphans living in the village.
In the Central African Republic, children make up a vast section of the country's population, as nearly half of all Central Africans are less than 14 years old. 370,000 of these children are orphans and grow up without one or both parents.
