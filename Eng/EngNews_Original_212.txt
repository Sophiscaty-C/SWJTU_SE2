Supporting Africa's development accords with common int'l interests - World - Chinadaily.com.cn
BEIJING - It is the common responsibility of the international community to work for peace, stability and development in Africa, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.
Spokesperson Geng Shuang was responding to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's remarks that China's approach to development in Africa "encourages dependency" that undermines sovereignty and puts stability at risk.
China is happy to see diverse international partners in Africa, Geng said, noting that developed countries should have the greatest commitments there.
Rather than making irresponsible remarks on African countries' efforts for development and foreign cooperation, related countries should support Africa's peace and development and make more contribution to Africa's development, Geng said.
African countries and their people are best qualified to say whether China-Africa cooperation is good or not, he said.
He added that China and Africa are in close contact to prepare for the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which will be held in September this year.
"We believe that the summit will be very fruitful and will inject new impetus to Africa's development and China-Africa cooperation," Geng said.
